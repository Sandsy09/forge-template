# Stage 13 — Data Science CLI Integration

## Epic

[CF-EPIC-13 / create-forge#103](https://github.com/Sandsy09/create-forge/issues/103)
exposes the released Data Science composition through `new --engine-preview`.

## Dependencies

CF-EPIC-13 is natively blocked by completed `create-forge#91` and
FT-EPIC-12. Both predecessors are complete, so Stage 13 is actionable.

## Child sequence

1. [CF-13.01 / create-forge#106](https://github.com/Sandsy09/create-forge/issues/106)
   adopts the released `forge-template` 0.4 compatibility line.
2. [CF-13.02 / create-forge#107](https://github.com/Sandsy09/create-forge/issues/107)
   defines generic component-selection CLI conventions.
3. [CF-13.03 / create-forge#108](https://github.com/Sandsy09/create-forge/issues/108)
   implements discovery-driven capability and platform selection.
4. [CF-13.04 / create-forge#109](https://github.com/Sandsy09/create-forge/issues/109)
   prompts and serialises options for every selected component.
5. [CF-13.05 / create-forge#110](https://github.com/Sandsy09/create-forge/issues/110)
   validates the Data Science preview pipeline against the released engine.

The sequence begins with CF-13.01, now that create-forge #91 and FT-12.04 are
complete, then proceeds linearly through preview-pipeline validation.

## Entry criteria

- create-forge #91 is complete.
- forge-template Stage 12 has published a compatible engine release.

## Outcomes

- Discover archetypes and applicable capabilities through the public facade.
- Prompt for component selections and declared options without hard-coded IDs.
- Preserve explicit empty selections and namespace options by owner.
- Construct, validate, render, stage, lock, and finalise through the shared
  ProjectSpec pipeline.
- Present compatibility and selection failures before destination effects.
- Preserve Library, CLI Application, default Copier, and no-engine behavior.

## Exit criteria

Interactive and non-interactive users can request a valid Data Science
composition through the preview path, with generic tests and no copied engine
semantics.

## Non-goals

The engine path does not become the default and create-forge gains no template
or component catalogue.
