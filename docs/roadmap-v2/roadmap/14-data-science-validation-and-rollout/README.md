# Stage 14 — Data Science Validation and Rollout

## Epics

- [FT-EPIC-14 / forge-template#99](https://github.com/Sandsy09/forge-template/issues/99)
  reviews composition and publishes the reviewed engine line.
- [CF-EPIC-14 / create-forge#104](https://github.com/Sandsy09/create-forge/issues/104)
  adopts that release and completes real client validation.

## Dependencies

FT-EPIC-14 is natively blocked by CF-EPIC-13. CF-EPIC-14 is natively blocked
by FT-EPIC-14, enforcing provider review and release before client adoption.

## Child sequence

forge-template completes provider review first:

1. [FT-14.01 / #113](https://github.com/Sandsy09/forge-template/issues/113)
   is complete: it reviewed the three-archetype composition boundaries after
   CF-13.05 and found no production defect.
2. [FT-14.02 / #114](https://github.com/Sandsy09/forge-template/issues/114)
   is next: it runs cross-repository compatibility validation against both
   main branches.
3. [FT-14.03 / #115](https://github.com/Sandsy09/forge-template/issues/115)
   publishes and verifies the reviewed `forge-template` 0.4.1 release.

create-forge then completes client rollout:

1. [CF-14.01 / create-forge#111](https://github.com/Sandsy09/create-forge/issues/111)
   adopts the reviewed 0.4.1 engine release.
2. [CF-14.02 / create-forge#112](https://github.com/Sandsy09/create-forge/issues/112)
   runs installed-console Data Science end-to-end validation.
3. [CF-14.03 / create-forge#113](https://github.com/Sandsy09/create-forge/issues/113)
   completes existing-path regressions and failure validation in parallel with
   CF-14.02.
4. [CF-14.04 / create-forge#114](https://github.com/Sandsy09/create-forge/issues/114)
   publishes create-forge 0.3.0 and completes roadmap v2.

## Entry criteria

- create-forge Stage 13 exercises the full Data Science composition. Met.
- All three archetypes and the selected capabilities have executable evidence.
  Met by FT-14.01's
  [composition review](../../../composition-architecture-review.md).

## Outcomes

- Review ownership, duplication, extension points, compatibility, security,
  reproducibility, package size, and maintenance cost.
- Correct any Foundation or component boundary defects.
- Publish and verify the reviewed forge-template release.
- Adopt its compatible range in create-forge.
- Generate Data Science through the real console script, verify its lock, and
  run its canonical checks and notebook validation.
- Re-run Library, CLI Application, and Copier-path regressions.
- Publish any required create-forge release and close the roadmap milestones.

## Exit criteria

The released client and engine pair supports Data Science behind
`--engine-preview`, all epics and their children are complete, and the
cross-repository graph and documentation describe the shipped state.

## Non-goals

No default engine cutover, plugin system, policy resolver, deployment
platform, or unrelated archetype is introduced.
