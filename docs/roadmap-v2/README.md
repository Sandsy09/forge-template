# Forge Data Science Roadmap — Two-Repository Edition

This roadmap continues the completed
[Forge Foundation roadmap](../roadmap-v1/README.md) through Stages 10–14.
It plans the next production archetype without reopening the Foundation,
composition, reference-client, or Blueprint decisions completed in Stages
00–09.

The target is a package-backed, notebook-oriented Data Science project with
reusable optional capabilities. Exact scientific libraries, notebook front
ends, data-versioning systems, model tooling, and deployment integrations are
not selected here; Stage 10 owns those decisions.

Delivery remains behind `create-forge new --engine-preview`. Retiring the
default direct-Copier path is a separate future initiative.

Stages 10–12 are complete. The package-bound Data Science catalogue is
available in [`forge-template 0.4.0`](https://github.com/Sandsy09/forge-template/releases/tag/v0.4.0);
Stage 13 now owns deliberate adoption and discovery-driven CLI integration.

## Repository roles

- **forge-template** owns the Data Science contract, capabilities, archetype,
  composition review, generated content, and engine releases.
- **create-forge** owns discovery-driven user input, ProjectSpec construction,
  diagnostics, staging, lock finalisation, and end-to-end client validation.

See the [architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md),
[ownership model](REPOSITORY-OWNERSHIP.md), and
[stage roadmap](ROADMAP.md) for the complete boundary.

## Live GitHub work

Six epics and 24 child issues are filed across the two repositories. GitHub
issue bodies and native parent/dependency relationships are authoritative:
